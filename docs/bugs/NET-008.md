# NET-008: snake_case Schema Normalization Silently Failed

## Status: ✅ Fixed (v1.2.1)

## Summary
`ObjectMaterializer.Create<T>(schema, params)` silently produced default values when schema columns used snake_case naming (e.g., `first_name`) and target properties used PascalCase (e.g., `FirstName`). No exception was thrown — users received empty/zero-value objects.

## Impact
**High** — Affects any CSV, Snowflake, or Spark data with snake_case columns. Silent data loss with no warning.

## Root Cause
Two code paths in ObjectMaterializer bypassed the 5-pass `SchemaMemberResolver`:
1. `BuildSchemaAction()` in `MemberMaterializationPlan.cs` — member-feeding path for mutable classes
2. `CreateViaPrimaryConstructorWithSchema()` in `ObjectMaterializer.cs` — constructor path for records

Both used a direct `schemaDict.TryGetValue(member.Name, ...)` dictionary lookup, which only supported exact (Pass 1) and case-insensitive (Pass 2) matching. Passes 3-5 (normalized, resemblance, Levenshtein) were never invoked.

The `SchemaMemberResolver` existed and worked correctly — it was just not called from these paths. It was only used by `ResolveSchemaToMembers<T>()` in the CSV/YAML streaming readers.

## Fix
Route both paths through `SchemaMemberResolver.ResolveSchemaToMembers<T>(schema)` before building the mapping dictionary. This resolves schema names to actual member/parameter names using the full 5-pass pipeline.

## Tests Added
- `10_SnakeCaseNormalization.cs` — 5 tests covering:
  - `first_name` → `FirstName` (audit reproduction)
  - Snowflake columns (`order_id`, `total_amount`, `customer_name`)
  - Records with snake_case constructor parameters
  - Single-word (passes via existing case-insensitive)
  - Mixed exact + snake_case columns
